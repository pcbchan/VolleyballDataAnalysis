The higher the player jumps, the better the scoring chance. Although it is intuitive that one scores better with higher approach jumps, it is unexpected that other factors like experience(indicated by the number of world championships/olympic games), height, weight, standing jump and age are not related to attack scoring. (It is, of course, expected that shirt number is not related though. Adding shirt number as a variable was just for fun, haha) \n",

After the study, we could observe from the visualization that teams win more at low travel distance than at high travel distance. This might indicate that the higher the travel distance, the worse the match performance. However, the trend is not very obvious. It might require further studies to confirm the relationship."
